## 🎤 Voiceover: Record Separately or Live?

**Option 1: Record Separately (Recommended)**
- More control over pacing
- Can re-record audio without re-filming
- Easier to sync in editing

**Option 2: Record Live**
- More natural feel
- Faster production
- Risk of mistakes

**My Recommendation:** Record screen first, add voiceover in editing.
