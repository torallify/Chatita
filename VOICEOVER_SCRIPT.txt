[0:00 - INTRO - 20 seconds]

Living with diabetes means making hundreds of decisions every day.

What can I eat? How will this affect my blood sugar? Am I doing this right?

It's exhausting. And often, you're doing it alone.

That's why I built Chatita.

[0:20 - INTRODUCTION - 15 seconds]

Chatita is named after my grandmother, who lives with diabetes.

She's your AI health companion - warm, supportive, and always there to help you make better choices.

[0:35 - MEAL LOGGING - 40 seconds]

Here's where Chatita shines. Just take a photo of your meal.

Using AI, Chatita automatically detects what you're eating and gives you a complete nutrition breakdown.

[pause 3 seconds while results appear]

Calories, carbs, protein, fat, fiber, sugar, sodium - everything you need to know, instantly.

But Chatita doesn't just give you numbers. She asks how you felt, because diabetes isn't just physical - it's emotional too.


---

[1:15 - INSIGHTS - 25 seconds]

After a week of logging, Chatita analyzes your patterns.

She celebrates your wins, gently suggests improvements, and helps you understand what's working.

And because progress should be shared, you can send your weekly report to family, your doctor, or your support system.

Managing diabetes is a journey, and Chatita celebrates every step.

Track your progress, unlock milestones, and earn rewards as you build healthier habits.

From your first week to a full year of consistency - Chatita is there, cheering you on.

[2:00 - PERSONALIZATION - 15 seconds]

Chatita is personal. Your name, your language, your journey.

Everything adapts to you, because this is YOUR health story.


---

[2:15 - CLOSING - 15 seconds]

Chatita isn't just an app. It's a companion.

Named after my grandmother, built for everyone who's navigating diabetes and needs support.
