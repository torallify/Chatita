## 🎥 Scene-Specific Checks

### Scene 1 (Intro):
- [ ] Logo/branding assets ready

### Scene 2 (Home):
- [ ] App opened to Home screen
- [ ] Greeting showing correctly
- [ ] Glucose reading displayed

### Scene 3 (Meals) ⭐ MOST IMPORTANT:
- [ ] Food photo selected and ready
- [ ] Backend running (AI analysis will work)
- [ ] Tested that AI analysis completes (15-30 sec)
- [ ] Know what the analysis results will show

### Scene 4 (Insights):
- [ ] Insights have been generated at least once
- [ ] Have data from past week
- [ ] Share feature works

### Scene 5 (Rewards):
- [ ] Milestones initialized
- [ ] Progress bar showing

## ⏱️ Final Timing Check

Run through the entire flow once more and time it:

- [ ] Intro: 20 seconds
- [ ] Home: 15 seconds
- [ ] Meals: 40 seconds (HERO MOMENT - take your time!)
- [ ] Insights: 25 seconds
- [ ] Rewards: 20 seconds
- [ ] Settings: 15 seconds
- [ ] Closing: 15 seconds

**Total: ~2:30**

Too fast? Slow down, let viewers absorb.
Too slow? Cut some screens or speed up transitions.

## 🎬 Recording Strategy

### Option A: All at Once (Harder but Faster)
Record the entire demo in one take
- Pros: Natural flow, faster production
- Cons: One mistake = start over
- **Best for:** Experienced presenters

### Option B: Scene by Scene (Easier)
Record each scene separately, edit together
- Pros: Can perfect each section, less pressure
- Cons: More editing work
- **Best for:** First-time demo creators ✅ **RECOMMENDED**

### Option C: Multiple Full Takes
Record 2-3 complete demos, choose best
- Pros: Options to choose from
- Cons: Time-consuming
- **Best for:** When you have extra time

**My Recommendation: Option B** - Record each scene separately!

---

## 📸 Equipment Positions

If recording with device in frame:
- [ ] Camera at eye level with device
- [ ] Device screen clearly visible
- [ ] Hands visible when tapping (if applicable)
- [ ] Good lighting on screen (no glare)

If screen recording only:
- [ ] Cursor/finger pointer visible (if needed)
- [ ] Recording area clean (no desktop clutter)
- [ ] Simulator/device fits within frame

---

## 🆘 Emergency Troubleshooting

**If backend won't start:**
```bash
cd chatita-mvp/backend
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
npm run dev
```

**If app won't launch:**
```bash
cd chatita-mvp/app
npx expo start --clear
```

**If AI analysis fails:**
- Check backend is running
- Check API key in `.env` file
- Test with: `curl http://localhost:3000/health`

**If you make a mistake while recording:**
- Don't worry! Just pause, take a breath
- Start that section over
- You'll edit out mistakes later
